# OpenLearningStatics

This project was for converting old flash animations to HTML5 / Javascript for the modern web.

OpenLearning is a for-profit educational technology institution based in Australia that offers a social online learning platform that can deliver massive open online courses. This particular project was for their online Statics course.

To view each animation, just clone the repo and open the corresponding html file.
